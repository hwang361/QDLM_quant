## 👀 Introduction


- We present the **first systematic study** on quantizing diffusion-based language models (dLLMs).

- This repository implements **state-of-the-art post-training quantization (PTQ)** methods for dLLM, including **GPTQ**, **AWQ**, **SmoothQuant**, **QuaRot**, and **DuQuant**.

- We comprehensively investigate the **impact of quantization** on dLLMs across **four key dimensions**: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model architecture.



## 🔧 Installation
```bash
conda create -n qdlm python=3.10 -y
conda activate qdlm
git clone https://github.com/FelixMessi/QDLM
# pip install --upgrade qdlm (error occurs)
cd QDLM
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install math-verify==0.8.0 antlr4-python3-runtime==4.11.0 sympy==1.14.0
cd lm-evaluation-harness && pip install -e .
```

To run evaluation for QuaRot, please download and install the [fast-hadamard-transform](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/fast-hadamard-transform/releases) with your cuda version.



## ⚙️ Usage

Please check [Dream](Dream.md) for code and math evaluation results of Dream-7B-Instruct.

Please refer to the `scripts` folder for running different weight-only quantization methods (AWQ, GPTQ) and weight–activation quantization methods (SmoothQuant, QuaRot, DuQuant).

Please download the LLaDA-base/LLaDA-Instruct or Dream models and replace the `MODEL_PATH` with your specific paths.

Detailed usage instructions are provided in the corresponding shell scripts.
